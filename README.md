# Find key that's out of tune
This is a simple game where the player tries to guess which random key is out of tune. The key will initially be 25% out of tune (where 100% is a half step), but that amount will decrease by 10% with each successful guess. The game ends when the difference is too subtle for the player to discern and they guess incorrectly. A live version of this game is hosted at <https://huntr.org/tune/>.
